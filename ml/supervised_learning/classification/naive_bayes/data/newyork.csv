I appreciate honesty and sincerity and when given these things you will always have my utmost respect. I'm a good person with a big heart not just with big heart alone but with big tits and nice bum, however, nothing will set me off into B*tch mode faster than to insult my intelligence and take my kindness for weakness. 

My Best Features:
 My caring heart and a loving spirit. I've been told by those closest to me that my eyes reveal the beautiful spirit that I possess and that my smile can light up a room filled with darkness. I believe in being honest and true to one's self so having said that I know that I can be demanding however I don't expect more from anyone than I am willing to give of myself."

I desire a connection with someone brilliant, successful and sophisticated. As a woman, I know what I deserve...do you?"
5,"29, single, white, plus size/bbw female from queens here. 

Haven't been having any luck on dating sites and figured I'd try this out. Not keeping my hopes up because unfortunately it seems like there's just a lot of creeps on here. 

I'm looking for a connection with someone and if we click the ideal outcome would be a long term relationship. I'm not trying to jump into something that quickly but that's the end goal. 

I'm 5'7, have a few tattoos, blonde hair and green eyes. I love music and am very laid back. Open minded, not religious and I'll make you laugh for sure!

I'm honestly usually only attracted to white guys/light skinned Hispanic guys that are taller than me. I'm sorry, but it's just a preference. We're all entitled to one! 

ONLY message me if you're 26-36 and you fit the above, I don't want to waste anyone's time. Send a pic and change the subject to your favorite band!"

JUNCTION BOULEVARD - A Novel by R.M. Scorpio

""The plan had gone straight to hell. The others were dead--or locked up--and if I didn't think of something fast, I'd be next..."" 

A streetwise teenager with nothing to lose. A token booth clerk with no way out. A desperate heist that goes horribly wrong. Just another dark detour down JUNCTION BOULEVARD. . . 

Set on the seedy streets and subways of 1980's Corona, Queens, JUNCTION BOULEVARD blends psychological suspense with urban angst to present a crime-thriller about the pursuit and price of redemption.

Like the trains that rumble overhead, these two strangers rarely intersect, meeting only at key junctures.

Now, their destinies collide, converging on a desperate heist. But Rico and John learn there are no free rides on this dark detour through Hell--more commonly known as JUNCTION BOULEVARD.

You're well educated -- this part is important to me for long term compatibility. You are self-sufficient and responsible. Eventually, you want to have a family. You went to a great school. You're also a little kinky in bed and love sex. Romantic gestures aren't lost on you. If any of this interests you message me!"

You: WJM. Intelligent. Cute. Sweet and charming, but bold and able to take charge, too. Highly educated. Open-minded and adventurous. 420 friendly. Music lover. Also divorced or single - just have some time to play, please? And be able to separate from your smart phone for an hour, maybe even two. Mid-30's-late 40's. Likely an MOT since I am one and that's who I tend to be attracted to. (And, if you need to ask what that is, you're not.) Our passions may be different (although a passion for jambands and road trips would be excellent), but please be passionate about something - whether art, literature, music, vino, classic cars or sports. 

Both of us are looking for a like-minded soul. Tend to be bored with plain vanilla folks. We both have a bit of a currently untapped wild streak that wouldn't be immediately obvious if we met in our 9-5 lives.

62,"I'll probably be flagged and removed but had to take the shot. I'm tired of being alone so I posted here hoping I get lucky. I am an African-American woman (secretly) living with HIV. I have never been one to sleep around nor use any type of drugs. I was infected by a long-term partner, who I foolishly trusted. I was broken-hearted and it hurt for a long time. Time to move past it. I want a man in my life on a romantic level. I miss it. I deserve it! I've been searching endlessly for a compatible man with the same condition. I have my reasons for seeking an HIV+ partner. If you ask me why, I'll tell you. Little to no luck on the STD dating sites so I came here. 
Here goes...
I am dark-skinned, over 40, have an average face and a plump, imperfect body. Hold off on sending pics as I'd like to determine if we have anything in common before breaking anonymity. I'm the quiet type unless engaged and stimulated. Comfortable silences are very underrated. I enjoy simple pleasures. Care more about the content of your character than the contents of your wallet. I have my own interests and we don't have to be joined at the hip. But a man who likes you will make the time. I don't do drama, stress, pressure or arguments. I'll just be gone.

-HIV+ men ONLY. Need to see that in print.
-Negative men contacting me after I've asked them not to...are you crazy? Why walk this road if you don't have to? Your motives and intentions will be suspicious from the start. 
-Actual first date...very little expense (coffee? ice cream? a stroll with my arm in yours?) and easy, comfortable conversation is what works for me. Broad daylight, public place, short and sweet. Despite my circumstances, I am still a lady...in public. After we part, if you call me again, I'll know you're seriously interested. I won't call you after our first date. I appreciate a man who takes the lead. 
-No attached men. Period. I look forward to frequent ""get-togethers"" with my special friend and don't like to share. I'm very selfish in that regard. Also, it's one thing if you take the risk for yourself. But if there's someone at home...not cool.
-Not at all attracted to super-skinny men (under 175 lbs.). I'm very thick, don't want to break you and sometimes heavy lifting will be involved. Just got an image in my head of a hotdog in a hamburger bun. LOL.
-Facial hair is a no-no for me unless it's very short and neatly trimmed. 
-I like a man who prefers calling to texting, even if it's brief. Hearing your voice makes me smile. Always thought texting should be a secondary means of communication when you're involved with someone. 

TURN-OFFS...
-Poor hygiene
-Illegal drugs (yes, even weed).
-Hard, heavy drinkers.
-Bisexual men who don't share that little tidbit of info BEFORE intimacy occurs.

I took the time and made the effort to spell things out. It's a big step for me. Hope the man who responds is available, ready, willing and able to take two steps towards me."
63,"I just want a large man who would want to suckle three times a week. I Live & work in North Jersey and I would host, I am also LI for part of my week most weeks. Attractive Latina, under 40, 145lbs shapely. Long auburn hair (I dye it sometimes brown or blonde) I enjoy the pleasures of being suckled for a long period of time. I find larger men to be irrisistable because they tend to have huge hearts and an incredible appetite. Just feast on me for hours HOPEFULLY and the attraction and chemistry is right....who knows. Pics for pics.
chat soon"

66,"Ages 34 - 45. Looking for someone to get to know, hang out, and see where it takes us. Laughter is good for the soul, so you must enjoy laughter. Someone not looking for a casual hook up. I want something a little bit more than that. I have HSV(herpes/cold sores). You would be surprised how many ppl are. 1 out of 4 is a lot.

Thank you for your time"
69,"If you are like me, your sentimental education has been a bit topsy turvy. Even so you do not approach relationships the way the burn victim approaches the stove, but rather do your best at building on what you have learned along the way and feel ready to cook again. You are 55-62 and live within a reasonable distance from Brooklyn, your heart is bigger than your well-developed frontal cortex, and your lizard brain is not tamed. You are secular and lean to the left. You are unattached and available. You have opinions and like women with opinions. You have passions, but your passions do not dictate you. You know difference between right and wrong, but you're not dogmatic. In your reply you will not be compelled to quote the Beatles, nor use the words: fireplace, beach, full head of hair."
70,"why 9 to 5? because then we have the rest of the day and weekends to ourselves.....you know, you can look for a job, you can look for an apartment, but looking for a compatible partner is the hardest part of life....we want the perfect shape, the perfect wallet, the perfect look, the perfect height and we lose the possibility that something beautiful can happen...if you are single 45+ and frustrated with the singles' scene...lets try to find each other."

92,"Hi everyone! I'm a 36/f/from westchester county, ny (Ossining). I work as a Teacher Assistant/After School Instructor at a non-profit organization. I love what I do..not many people can say that. Anyway, I have been told I'm a total sweetheart. I'm Italian and Russian. I am 5'3/ reddish-brown hair/brown eyes/sweet smile. One other thing about me is that I am a type 1 diabetic and have been since April 2007. I love life and everything it has to offer. I love my family and friends and am always there for them. I enjoy playing pool, going bowling, watching television & movies, sports, and now more recently going to the gym.

Here are some things I am looking for in someone to enjoy life with (in no particular order of importance):

1. between the ages of 33 and 45 ( I know totally random numbers for my age range).

2. live in Westchester, Putnam, or Dutchess counties in New York

3. caucasian guy (i'm sorry to everyone else but that is who i tend to be most attracted to) 

4. enjoys watching and playing sports of any kind

5. romantic/affectionate (enjoys PDA) 

6. loves movies, music and television

7. would be my best friend as well as my boyfriend and lover ?

8. enjoys open communication throughout the day (not an overkill) 

9.  is an all around great guy 
10. enjoys a variety of activities and going different places

I should point out one thing....I am NOT looking for a ""friends with benefits"" relationship. I tried that once before and did not work out so well. 
I hope that you take some time to read this ad and respond to me. Please contact me through craigslist and I will email you back. Please attach a picture with your email if you are able to and if not then a description. I did not attach a picture because I will send one if I receive one back. Thanks everyone!"
93,"I'm a big white girl looking for an ongoing relationship with a BBC.  Be single, drug and disease free."
94,"Only contact me if you are serious about no longer dating.  I'm a real citizen/woman.

I'd like to meet up with you for a lovely date. I'm a very sensual person, but only for the one that I belong to. I'd like to meet after work, or make weekend plans. Only stable, athletic & single gentlemen. I will only respond to face pics.  You will receive mine."
95,"I'm a 40 year old Asian/American woman, but I look like I'm in my early 30's.  I have long dark hair, I'm a little chubby (emphasis on little) but I started to work out again, I'm 5 ft, 36b/c, no children but would love to have one (I know that window is closing soon).  I have a good job, have my own condo, am a great driver - but don't own a car (so I hope my dream man isn't too far or doesn't mind driving to me...lol)

I have the wonderful gift (HSV2), but it's not really an issue for me.  I've had 2 outbreaks in the last 6 yrs. 

A few words that describe me would be....cute, intelligent, easy going, adventurous, organized, sweet, sexy, playful, independent, affectionate, caring, social homebody (oxymoron I know, but very true). I'm usually up for trying new things once; even if I'm a little scared to do so. After all you, you'll never know what you like until you try it. 

I grew up in NJ, but by no means am I a ""Jersey girl"" like the ones on jersey shore...lol I have 2 little dogs that are my ""hairy crew"" that are always making me laugh. I like the syfy channel and have to admit that I watch Chrisley knows best...I can't believe I just admitted to that...lol Don't worry, it's the only reality show I watch :) I love PB&J; sandwiches, but forget that I do until I take a bite out of one 

I enjoy traveling and seeing new places and cultures. I've been to several countries, but there is still so much of the world to discover. I'm more of a nice hotel kinda gal, but I also enjoy camping :) I'd love to find a man who wants to see the world with me and share all of life's ups and downs. Bonus points if you're a diver like me :)

Please don't contact me if you're only looking for sex, unemployed or just want to tell me nasty things."

97,"I'm from Kuwait, I live in NY now. I'm an immigrant here and i'm super lucky to be welcomed and have respect, America saved my country once, and respected me here, I am honored and proud to be here. In my wildest dreams I wish to bring an American Army man and introduce him to my mother and sister. They visit often and I would like to have this opportunity. 

My dad was a POW and you guys freed him. He wasn't a good man and he also never gave my mom an orgasm in her life so I guess I hope an American Army man would be able to do that at some point and put him in his place and make her happy for once."
