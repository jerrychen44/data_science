Looking for someone who are sure of what they are looking for; Read the ad well BEFORE contacting me!

5,"Just like the title says

You are:
Caucasian, very attractive, 28-38
Secure, grounded and kind. A giver... like me.
Creative types are encouraged. Tattooed ex hipsters turned UX designers. Whatever your vice. I am attracted to passionate people. Those who feel connected to nature, and have a love for femininity. Someone who has done his emotional homework and is ready for something with depth. I so dont resonate with the ADD style dating that this city is now famous for. When I bond with someone, I stay through thick and thin...

I honestly love what I do and do very, very well. I feel like a healer of sorts...able to meet peoples needs in a safe, straightforward way. Its fun. It makes me happy. Trips abroad, dinner dates, and unlike the medias representation of it all..I am typically treated like gold.

But they only see the ""perfect me"" when I work.
The true me is saved for friends and my lover.

Physically speaking, I'm curvaceous, and lush...dark blond. Blue grey eyes, not a ton of make up. Lots of booty. Tattooed.

My heart is open to the right guy. My special person, my rock. I am very compartmentalized, I suppose, I have always had a loving supportive partner while Ive worked. I'm turning to Craigslist even though this place is seedy because it actually has struck gold for me once before ;) Bring me someone amazing and loving...

My interests are varied: FLR, documentaries, personal growth, art exhibitions, world travel, animal welfare, ayahuasca, shamanism, cutting edge technology, video games. I am snuggly, deeply emotional, committed to personal growth, laughter, connection and creativity

No poly people. No married dudes. I cant believe I have to write that but apparently, from experience, I do. I have no desire for kids...so someone childfree would be great

Please share a pic when you reply...I have some to share as well
without a photo I am unlikely to read your response, honestly
Im in my 30's but still pass for 27 ;) good genes here...

hope to hear from you"
6,"Hi,
I'm 24, latina, chubby/fat, smart, sweet, witty, and kind.
I tend to like men older than myself.
Have a great night!"
7,"Hi , I am turning 49 this weekend, I am tall, plus size, employeed and dark blonde. I am attracted to tall, white men with a deep voice, and great smile. Realize I am turn 50 in a year and I am not where I want to be. 
If u are up for chatting put a bucket list item in your subject line and tell me about u self. No naked pics please. Use u imagination."
8,"Hello  :) 

I love the rain.....

I am very down to earth and at a good place in my life. I am so ready for someone who is genuine and real... so if this fits you so far... please continue. I don't frequent bars and don't get out much... I am usually at work, at the track .. or with my kids... so thought this would be a good way to find someone. I love just about anything and if I haven't tried it before, I will give it a whirl... 

I appreciate the small things in life and never ever take anything for granted. I am as honest as they come and don't know how to be any other way. I want to find my best friend this time! I'm too old for games or liars... 

I am very open, spontaneous, (however I do like to plan things out too), I love kids, coaching distance runners, camping (but haven't done it lately), I like to surprise my guy with little things to keep things fresh... Relationships take hard work and keeping it fresh is very important. In a week, a month, a year, 5 years... 20 YEARS.. I want to feel that spark... *wink... all we need is honesty and laughter.. yep. 

No one under 47 or over 57 please.

I know there has to be a physical attraction, but what is more important to me is if we ""connect"". Humor is so important too. Thanks for reading! If we don't talk... have a Great 2016!"
9,"Wanted (hopefully alive): A grown-up 60+ gentleman with a twinkle in his eye - ready to engage in a grown-up
relationship with a self-realized woman of substance - ready to see more of the world together.......


I enjoy movies, plays, concerts, travel, etc. - ready to be a partner in a fulfilling and boldly adventurous life with lots
of time together on the home front as well.


If you know who Gaudi is, you will understand my physique - no flat surfaces - all curves in all the right places - and prepared to round out a liaison that is pleasing to both of us.



After all, a home is not really a home if there is no one there to hold you and kiss you good-nite.



If you are single and geographically desirable, then let's just take a chance and meet - let the chips fall where they may. We have nothing to lose!

Please include a photo,  your age,  and the city that you live in with your reply.

Again - please be over 60."
10,"Single, very tall, with dark hair. Would like to find someone to spend time with and eventually have a relationship. 
I'm mellow and a home body these days so it would be great if you enjoyed hanging out with me. Talk and make dinner together. Watch and movie and cuddle up. Stuff like that. 
I'm shy and soft spoken. Not dumb or a doormat. I just won't jockey for position in a conversation. 
I find most people like to talk and I'm okay listening. Although it would be amazing to find someone interested in me. 
I'd love to do all the activities you enjoy but chances are I might be too low key to run all over the place. I met an amazing guy on here but had to face the music that it wouldn't turn into a relationship because he was so busy with things all the time and I knew I couldn't keep up. Bummer. But I'm realistic. 
Things I enjoy. Museums, reading, dancing, shopping, travel and road trips, hole-in-the-wall places, days at the beach, hiking."
11,"Can't help but feel lonely tonight. :( I don't know where to meet someone, it's weird to go to a bar alone to meet someone. I hate dressing up anyway and I feel I would be deceiving someone that way. Anyway I'm wondering if there are any lonely guys who want th meet someone new? By lonely I mean you haven't been with anyone in long time (like me). I'm just a single Asian gal in the Bay Area. I'm not into social events but I dig movies and music. I live a simple and frugal life. 
If anyone want to chat on gmail, send me a reply with an intro about yourself . Please be older and I don't exchange pics. 'll be up for a few more hours."
12,"please Baby,

call me.

Too many misunderstandings in text.

You know our hearts belong together."

14,"Are you looking for a new love, a new partner in crime? A woman to grow old with?
I'm looking for a single man, middle age and happy. I am middle age and I love it. Only one thing missing, love and all that that entails."
15,"As Antony said to Cleopatra, as he opened a crate of ale, ""Oh, I say.""

But was she listening--did she even care for ale?--or was her mind musing on some small observation the night before?

There will be time, she thought, time to talk, to muse, to let the music play--but who shall she share these moments with? Many men had written her, had been charmed by her voice among the shadows, hidden behind a screen, but these men faded with time as frequent as the dawn, another disappointing shadow swallowed by the sun. It was not friendship they were after.

Oh, how Helen of Troy was but a man's trophy wife, but that was neither Cleopatra's fate nor her desire. She wanted no great hero, no Odysseus or Paris: why must a good man be so hard to find? A man worth talking to, a man who was charming, witty, and valued beauty in the words--words that added to the physicality with a woman if that is where things should be concluded there--where was such a man to be found? 

The Antonys and Caesars of the world bored her. It was the eve of her 32nd birthday. She wondered where is a man who reads poetry and would write her letters that speak something meaningful to her heart. Where is the man who values building a beautiful friendship and seeing wherever that may go? 

Are you that man? Are your words playful, artful? Will you charm and make her laugh for her birthday?"

Low-maintenance old lady, former exotic vixen, now just single and silly, doing the groupie road trip thing on the weekends. I'll be coming into SC from SF, staying in town for the shows, then headed home (hopefully hungover, tanned, and sore from dancing) Monday morning. If sharing in any part of the adventure intrigues you - the drive, the shows, decent company, meeting a hilarious and respectable gal with whom to repeat these antics for more shows in CA beach towns - give me a shout and tell me about yourself.

I like men taller, more muscular/bulkier, more responsible and self-assured than average. Bored by potheads, emotionally guarded mid-life crisis sufferers and under-/oversexed married-but-looking types. If you like your women smarter, funnier, bustier, and less stuck-up than average, we'll have fun at the shows. It would probably help if you have know and love these performers as I do as an icebreaker, but not a requirement. And you don't have to dance unless you want to..."
24,"I'm not looking for a ""hookup"".  I value quality and depth of character.

You should have diverse interests and a fan of the great outdoor, generally happy and down to earth:)  

Must be: single (40-47 only), SAFE & CLEAN (drug/disease free), non-smoker, no body art.  Not already in a relationship(s) or getting out of one.        

Only respond if you're looking for the same.  I value my time and yours.  Friendship with common interests is a good starting point.   

Please include a Picture and tell me about yourself."

Picture of yourself also appreciated. :)

 Update: Making plans to visit/stay in Sausalito or Mill Valley for a month (hopefully July or August). I would love to have someone to explore the Bay Area and carpool to dances/hikes with. :)

 3) Under 40."
26,"Hello, I'm a divorced, college educated, professional female (software engineer). I'm attracted to Asian American men ( Korean, Japanese, Chinese).... No offense to others it's just a preference of mine. :-)


Interested in professional, easy-going man with a sense of humor. Seeking someone clean cut, well-rounded, and educated. Family, friends, and a balanced & healthy lifestyle are important. While I'm looking for the right LTR I'm not looking to rush things. Let's have fun getting to know each other and take it from there. Here list of a few more things I'm looking for.

-Non Smoker
-College degree
-Be financially responsible
-Single/Divorced (separated is not single or divorced)
-D/D free
-A nice/good guy
-No facial hair (I like to kiss and facial hair gets in the way)
-Be available emotionally and have time to put into a relationship. I know we're all busy here in the Bay area but make sure you have the time to put into a relationship to give it the best shot of working. 
-Live within 30 miles of Fremont.
-Appreciate bullet formatting. :-)
-I tend to do better with younger men... I'm 53 but have been told I look to be in my early 40s. Ideally 
40-53 would be my range but I wouldn't disqualify based on age. 
-Most importantly I'm not looking for a guy to just settle down and grow old with.... I want a true dynamic and passionate connection. I'm looking for all the trapping of a relationship. 

As for me I'm low maintenance and drama free. I have a positive attitude and enjoy life. I like outdoor activities but am comfortable hanging out at home. I am not materialistic and enjoy the simple things in life. I also try to lead a healthy lifestyle, I must confess I'm somewhat of a weekend foodie. :-) 

If interested, drop a line and tell me about yourself, No one liners, please use complete sentences and send a G-rated picture. I have a recent picture to share. In your reply post your location and age so I'll know you're real and your email doesn't end up in my Spam folder.

I'd like to exchange a few emails and then talk OTP before meeting to make sure we're a match. I don't want to exchange a lot of emails before meeting as I find a face to face is the best way to get to know a person. 

I posted this a few days ago and for some reason my post was deleted.  I tried to reply everyone that contacted me but not sure if the emails were able to be received because of the deletion.  I assure you I'm real...  If I weren't real I'd be much less specific right.  :-)

Thanks,
Deborah"
27,"Serious about my preferences, and that does include age.

I'm 42, latina, in search of my White Knight!

The things I would like out of this special friendship are, someone that I can connect with physically as well as intellectually. Someone I can have deep meaningful conversations to the lightest with! :) Someone to laugh and cry with. Share everything and anything, at full trust! Our secrets and only ours! Like special friends, soul mates... We can hangout, go out for lunch or dinner, have picnics, go for walks, hikes, travel/seek adventure, people watch, go to movies, or stay in, cook for each other, or together, teach me how to play videos games if you are a gamer?? =D haha. Put a flower in your head..or two! :) Be silly or cheesy together... cuddle, love each other. Simply just be together whenever we feel like, whenever life allows us to. I would like to find someone that I can care for and love, and in return do the the same for me. My heart is big and I would like to share it with someone special. It can be whatever we want it to be, as long as it is something meaningful and long lasting. See where this can lead.

I have been described by men as beautiful, cute, sexy, fun, funny, sweet and caring. To describe myself, I am caring, compassionate, passionate, hopeless romantic, sentimental, silly at times, but know when to be serious. I am a strong woman who can be vulnerable at times and I am not ashamed to say so. I have my flaws and I am very aware of them. They have helped me to learn and grow, better myself. They have made me the strong woman I am today, more and more each day. I am, simply put, a bubbly introvert.

I am attracted to younger men and they have always been attracted to me. We have always felt comfortable with each other, a special connection. I have been told I make them feel free, unleashed! And I too have always felt the same.

My preference is between the ages of late 30's to early 40's. I am attracted to slender build (average, depending on what you define average as. Haha), shy, introverted (I find this trait rather sweet, cute, attractive!), white/Caucasian guys, fair skinned with light eyes. Green, blue... No tattoos (well actually...It depends. How big are we talking and how many??). I am sorry, but it's what I like, and I have a right to my preference. It is what it is! As you have a right to yours! Please put your eye color in the subject line and describe yourself thoroughly including age so I'll know you read my preferences."

29,"Hi, I am a pretty lady in search of a handsome, articulate & single man who wouldn't mind going to an A's game soon.

C'mon what are you waiting for ! ;-)

Please be from 24-35 Age
I will share pictures upon receiving Pictures. 

thank  you"
30,"Perhaps one day I might come across it. Perhaps not. Perhaps the possibilities may have come and gone for me.

 I wonder if the magic spark can ever come back into my life? I often think about it...from time to time. Perhaps you might be thinking the same thing.

 Being in my 40s and a single Mom, I have to admit, I have been truly in love in my lifetime and there is nothing like it. Simply nothing. 

 It's funny but, it is finding that one person that when I look at him, words are hard to come out of my mouth. When I sit next to him, there is no need for words. Simply look into his eyes and two hearts feel it without one single word. 

 The most astonishing things is, when we are married, it is so easy to see that men are interested in us but, there is nothing we can do about it ....The loyal ones anyway:)When you are divorced with children, things are very different. The questions I ask are interesting: 

 Is it over for me? 
 Is it even possible to find, rediscover and feel love again in your 40s? 
 Will my heart go nuts with a simple kiss? 

 Is it really possible to bring someone into my family? When? It HAS to take a long time because I would never introduce a man to my family unless I was convinced he was there for seriously LONG TERM. 

 How do we find that one? I HATE dating. It's as bad as trying on shoes. When we were younger, it was SO easy to meet then let things all fall into place. Now, we put up all sorts of obstacles. 

 Me? I am a happy, pretty grounded, and content mother. It would seem that I don't really need anything in my life. BUT, there is always that 'time', when I am alone that I think to myself, ""could it be different'? I am stable, secure and most weeks, there are a couple of days I get lonely and find myself reading through these posts and wonder what it would be like to meet someone for a drink and get to know each other. I think about it each week and do nothing about it. Today, I am writing my thoughts on here. 
 What kind of man do I truly adore? 

 - He is: 100% SINGLE, 40-early 50s (PLEASE respect my age request), Caucasian or European born (just my preference), genuinely happy with life, a kind person, loyal, honest, communicative, empathetic, clean cut, fit, health conscious, gentle and yet strong, emotionally-mentally-financially well balanced, with good old values and no drama around. 
 - He has high integrity and believes honesty is the only policy, his word is SOLID...he is NOT into deception
 - He is spiritual or believes in God but is not a fanatic. . . 
 - He longs for and craves his woman to notice him and spend time with him and holds her hand. Stares into her eyes...
 - He is truly compassionate and very caring 
 - He knows how to balance a relationship between his kids, work and his woman. 
 - He is not afraid of commitment and is looking for a life partner...
 - He doesn't have to be perfect...I am not either

 He is my dream. He has been my dream for a few years however, I ask God to help me somehow, someway, bring him into my life, slowly, gently, most beautifully and most understandingly. 

 If you took the time to read this dreary yet emotional outpouring, responses are not only welcome, they are desired.

 Me? I am feminine, attractive, slender, caring, low key yet passionate, financially secure, well educated and have traveled a lot both here and overseas. I am spiritual, spontaneous, non-materialistic, down-to-earth. I am into fitness and healthy living but I am not a fanatic. I would like to be a great addition to someone's life. Especially if you are close to your parents and children. My family lives in another country and sometimes, that makes things pretty hard not being around them. 

 Whoever you are. . .Thank you kindly for reading. I hope I touched one heart that is in the same place as mine. Although we may never meet, there is a tiny chance, we will. If these words resonate with you and you answered 'yes, that's me', to my little wish list, then we really should chat.

 If you have had no criminal record; (never been in trouble with the law...because I can't have any example like that around my child) and are SINGLE (not Married) I'm open to conversation.

 I leave you with one last thought......One heart. With so many people in this entire world, why, oh why is it SO hard to find our ONE HEART?... I don't want to give up on believing I can find you and you, me. When two hearts become one, there is NOTHING like it in our life time.

 I realize my posting is long and only the kind of man I'm looking for will actually read it and respond thoughtfully...please give me a glimpse into your intellect and spirit. Please be courteous and respond with a recent, clear photo without glasses. 

 Please don't take it personal if I don't reply to you. I will, only do so if I believe there's resonance and potential compatibility at different levels. I won't respond to one liners, won't call you or text you. No indecent pics. Not looking for sex here, so don't waste your time sending sex requests. 

 Don't believe in long distance relationships, so Please be within 30 miles of the South Bay. 

 Thanks for reading and Good Luck in your search!"

I'd love to find someone who prides himself on being a gentleman, educated, sensual can carry on a decent conversation and is between 35 and 57 years old.

45,"Hi
I'm 42, single, white, never married/no kids, 5'9, brown hair, plus-size (BBW), atheist, independent, educated, musician, introverted, looking to meet new people to hang out with. I have a strong attraction towards Indians and Middle eastern men. My interests include gardening, music, dance, dining out, pottery, relaxing at home, animals, going to concerts, theater, and movies. My goal is to find friendship/companionship. If it develops into something more, then that is great too. The qualities that attract me are honesty, kindness, intelligence, humor, and logical thinking. 

I'm only interested in men who are:
-single. 
-at least 5'8,
-educated
-28-46 
-agnostic or atheist 
-a non-smoker/never done drugs
-willing to meet half-way. (I live in Sacramento.)

 When replying, please attach a clear, recent picture and tell me the basics about yourself. (Age, height, occupation, etc.) Thanks."
46,"I'm a 50-something woman with a playful and wise spirit who enjoys deep inquiry, engaging conversation and plenty of laughter. My interest is in finding and creating a committed partnership with someone whose body, brain, heart and soul are in good working order. Perfection is neither the goal nor the expectation. I am NOT interested in casual encounters of any kind, so please don't respond if that's your interest because you won't hear back from me. 

What matters in meeting is how we feel when we look in each other's eyes, what our hearts say when there is no need for words and how our bodies move together when there is no need for a dance floor. Resonance happens not with a mouse click but with the click that comes with presence and vulnerability and the willingness to show up with all of who we are. That's what matters to me, along with qualities like kindness and respect; hilarious humor and emotional intelligence; sexuality that is way too mature to ever be called casual and the recognition that the path of partnership, like nothing else, is a window into ourselves, each other and a very sweet way to move through the world. Really good kissing is way up there, too!

It's a stunningly gorgeous day and while I will squeeze every sweet moment out of it that I can, I also really want to share it with an extraordinary someone. 

Could that be you?

Want to join me as we delve into what's possible?"

Although you -- like me -- have traveled around the sun for quite a few decades, you are still active, attractive, bright, lively, fun, and engaged. We've both partnered before, but we're both single now, and we still long to experience and express once again the love that's in our hearts.

50,"You are quite a bit brighter than average, as am I.

And like me, you are a communicator; good with words.

You don't mind writing a few paragraphs in response to my ad, describing yourself.

I am 5'7"" tall, with blue eyes, long dark-blond hair.

Physically very fit and healthy but not gym-toned. A bit rounder than I'd like but not much. I walk a lot in the hills, for exercise.

(Photos tend to draw hate mail so I stopped posting them.)

Retired, secure but not wealthy. I don't need you for money.

I want you for: companionship, conversation, and the physical pleasures including massage and everything else joyous couples do together.

:-)

I treat you well, and expect the same in return. I am kind and giving, but not foolish. I do not accept mistreatment.


I like: concerts, plays, festivals, art, gardening, science, history, anthropology, science fiction, and more.

Specifically, I like baroque, classical, early, and renaissance music, as well as folk, world music, and some rock. When I go to Dickens Fair or Renaissance Faires, I dress the part.

My creativity takes many forms, including visual art and songs. My career was in high tech stuff, so I have that ""left brain"" thing going too.

I am very friendly, affectionate, and open. I tend to give people the benefit of the doubt.

However, I have learned. . . .

It's a wide internet out there, and most people are not compatible with me, or even looking for anything like what I'm looking for!

I AM Looking for a ""long term relationship"" with someone who is actually available for that (e.g not married).

I do not respond to hate mail, to generic replies, or to overly brief notes.

foods/restaurants, and great conversation.

Hoping to meet someone close to my age who is interested in getting to know a decent person.  Qualities I seek are down-to-earth, educated, sense of humor, well-rounded, and has his act together.  Also, i like the clean cut look. Health and fitness, spending time with friends, my faith and family are 
important and it would be nice he shares the same outlook.   If this sounds like someone you could hang out with for a little bit - drop a line. Please indicate age, interests, a little bit about yourself ."
52,"Went on vacation in Hawaii and quickly met a nice mature Polynesian man.  Tall, big muscles, nice tan, and handsome.  He showed me around the island.  We went back to his beach front house with a private beach.  We were naked and had wonderful sex.  He was very well endowed and nine inches and very very thick.  Slept naked with his arms around me.  We woke up early mornings and had sex and made love on the beach and in the warm waters, naked breakfast on the beach.  It was a wonderful romantic time. Ended up spend a whole week together and took me around secret place. We played around all over.  I am spoiled rotten now and am looking for someone with similar qualities."

57,I'm seeking a serious relationship but I have a serious condition that's called macromastia/gigantomastia and sometimes symptomatic. My condition causes me pain at times but I don't like to take medication I just rest. I'm looking for a man that can accept me with my condition. I want to find a nice man that will look at me for more than my condition. Right now I am in pain from my condition and have a hurt shoulder. I know this is a weird way to kind of say what I want but the best way I know how. I know guys that like trannies that say they are women and trannies that want to be treated as women are like ignore their penis. I want a man to treat me as if I am flat chested. I want to be liked for my brain and not my boobs. I am more than my boobs. My boobs cause me so many problems. As my caregiver sometimes I will need a back rub or my shoulders need to be rubbed. I would like to be more active but my condition stops me at times. If I had someone to help me maybe I can recover or become more active.

65,"I want someone to keep up, but also know that we are both better for being together. I'm confident, outgoing, always looking to take on a challenge, professionally successful, and personally together.

A few things about me:
- Pick my battles. Don't waste the energy and emotion on the stuff you really don't care about.
- I laugh a LOT. Sometimes even when I am in pain or sometimes to the point of pain.
- Intellectual and mental stimulation is the way to my heart and other parts of my body.
- I LOVE learning about new things. I'm a sponge.
- Giving is incredibly important to me.
- I thrive on new experiences. I like stretching.
- I work for sport meaning I still need the money, but I do enjoy my work.

Things that are a little different about me
- I love to travel for fun, but also travel for work. I have been to 7 continents and over 20 countries.
- I am the person who will pretty much try anything.
- I've lived in about 10 states and I am not military.
- I am a sucker for the underdog, though this is probably true of a lot of people.
- I am incredibly decisive. I'd rather make the wrong decision than no decision at all.
- I am transparent and open to the point of painful though I am never mean about it.

I could continuing to create bullet points, but, ultimately, I realize that chemistry is in the nuance and can only be determined in person. Let's have a few email or chat exchanges and see if there's something worth leaving the house for."

68,"Nothing makes me happier than a good, long, thorough foot massage. It can get to the point where it triggers endorphins or is serving as an aphrodisiac in a sort of way.  I love them!

While I understand the foot fetish dynamic, I think I truly am seeking someone who gets genuine pleasure from making one woman feel perfect. Not to say that I wouldn't deal with someone with a foot fetish, I don't want this to be solely (no pun intended ha!) about feet related kink. It would be great to have sex and go to dinner etc..  I find myself attracted to nice guys who like to put a girl first. Foot massages are just at the top of my sexy time list... hehe.

I am tall and have been described as voluptuous but am height/weight proportion. I have long hair and keep a french pedicure. :) I work and live in SF, work out a few times a week and vote. For the most part I am unmaterialistic and enjoy watching sports on TV and going to games. Usually I spend my extra money on travel instead of clothes or hand bags.. What else, what else... oh yes an atheist and not a burning man person. Centerist. 

While usually I would avoid something like this, I post here because of the nature of this being so specific and well, it isn't first date appropriate conversation. I figure if this guy is out there, he is likely here or maybe at least looks here. He is likely other places too, but here for something that isn't first date appropriate as well.

Searching for a real man, with a good heart, and common sense.  MUST BE OVER 50 yrs old (do not reply if you are younger...seriously!).  I like men who have a good sense of who they are...not arrogant, but confident.  Don't care about height, weight, or if you have hair or not.  I do like tattoos, but am looking for what is inside.

I would prefer you have hobbies, such as; old cars, motorcycles, etc., where you have friends and do things, as I am not going to be your everything...just what you come home to and snuggle at night and smile when you think about me.  I will do the same.

I am 57 yrs old, have a good job and career.  I have my own home (me and the bank).  I have adult children.  Love dogs, and have one.  I am 5'3"" tall, overweight, blondish hair, and green eyes.  I have a sarcastic sense of humor, but intelligent.  I am a woman and think like one quite a bit of the time.  I am very patriotic, and love all holidays.  

If you really want to get to know me then send me something asking questions.  I don't want you to send me idiotic romance phrases...truly I can't imagine women in their 50's falling for it.  But, hey, to each their own.  I love romance, but seriously I do not know you and you do not know me, so start off by really trying to get to know me.

Why are you looking here?
Are you seeking a new romance?
Please reply if you have free weekday time.
No disappointments."
86,"Hello ....

I am in the Bay Area for the summer .... I am staying at my aunt and uncle's house while they are in Europe.  They are here until Sunday, so I won't really have time until then.

I wasn't sure that this would be the best place to put this ad - I'm not looking for super long term since I go back to Seattle at the end of August, but I don't know that I'm ready for ""casual encounter"" exactly.  I have only had one boyfriend and we only did a little bit of sex.  I also had a one night stand after we broke up.  I am a little shy in person but am open and honest when I feel comfortable.  I am a little overweight and am kind of self-conscious about it.  I have brown hair and am 5'5"".  I look younger than I am I think."
87,"Hi I'm Pen. I'm a mom, busy, and not looking to get harassed for sex or pics.
I'm just looking to have good conversation and take things slow. I'm African American 5'5, hazel eyes, high cheek bones, and full pink lips. I have tattoos (some you can see, others you cant;)) and I'm definitely BBW.

I like to read (understatement), cook, play and have good conversation.
I like to go to the movies, beach, and just drive.
I hate planning my own dates, paying for a man, and big men (sorry)

I'm looking for a FWM between 26-32 to talk with. I like my men sexy, tall (5'10 and up), and muscular to Athletic ""FIT"". Please don't respond if you are married or not what i described. I want someone who can hold a conversation, is a gentleman, likes music, laughing, and bbw woman. I want to talk with someone who values family, likes kids, and has a path planned for himself.
Message me if you fit that description. Put ""swirl"" in the subject bar, and tell me about yourself, what you like and why your here. You can send a pic now or later but you won't get mine till I get yours."
88,"Smart, flirty, playful, educated woman, looking for a fun and flirty intellectual equal who understands the value of good conversation and establishing a connection.  

Please be charming, fun and easy going - in reasonable shape and value playful banter.  If you understand that it's all about appealing to the mind, this could go well...  Easy on the eyes would be nice. And somewhere between the age of 40-50.

I am in reasonable shape, cute, exotic looking, silly and fun.

If so inclined, please reply to charm and appeal... short, one liners, and stupid pics will be deleted.

No drugs, disease, smokers, bad tempers, married men and anything generally not fun."
89,"It's been a while, and I needed that time to reconnect with myself. I'm feeling ready to date but for whatever reason, it's been tough. Maybe I'm more vulnerable than I think, or just need a little extra charisma to get things going.

I'm the kind of person who can turn on the dazzling charm and magnetize people to me. Sometimes I do it without realizing, if I'm looking and feeling good. Other times I have to consciously turn it on, and that can be very draining. Without the excitement of romance and sex in my life, I'm finding it hard to switch on. The last breakup was hard, it blew out my fire for a while.

I think to feel sexy and myself again, I need the frisson of chemistry with a hot and interesting man. I could be wrong, it might be me that brings all the magic. But I crave connection. 

I'm youthful for 39, attractive, fat and extremely curvy. Dark hair, fair skin, extraordinary style. I'm funny, thoughtful, easy to talk to. I've been in the city for a long time, and somehow manage to live the glamorous life I always wanted. Just my sex life has been missing for a while, which is dreary.

I love good looking, confident, and intelligent men. It helps if you are single. Being in San Francisco is crucial to this endeavor. Please be able to invite ladies to your home if you want to.

Write to me and include photos. I have photos to reciprocate.

Thank you for reading."
90,"This is a real ad. I am 5'6, green eyes and long brown hair, college educated and hard working. I am plus size and I know what I am looking for.
I am hoping to find a single white male between the ages of 28-38 who is intelligent, honest and appreciates a big woman. I'm NOT looking for FWB or a booty call.

Some guys on here will message me back saying your are too big to be too picky or whatever else close minded response, but everyone deserves love. No matter their size, race, etc.

If anything I said interests you please message me with a picture. I will send a picture only after you send one."
91,"Isn't that what we would like to enjoy with each other regularly?  I know I do and would so like something on going with nsa.  You are a SWM, 50 plus ,in a not working marriage  might be ok too, fun to be with,in good health,not bisexual."
92,"Smart and nerdish Asian girl seeking smart and nerdish guy for a Friday night date. Love to travel, hike, and explore. 5'6, Asian, seeking white or Asian between 28-38 yrs old, please send a photo and a few ideas for Friday :)"
93,"I'm single and looking for a nice man. From what I have noticed I like a original man that's quiet with good manners that won't hurt you. From my dating experience guys I have dated from these places are generally very respectful and care about my feelings and won't have sex with me unless married and I like that because they respect me. I'm not into every African or Asian guy I'm just looking for the one that's right for me. I want a man that's never been married that's, nice, smart, independent, no kids, educated, has a job or career. I don't want someone that's just nice and cute I want someone that gets me and I can have fun with. I want someone that's sweet and thinks of me but not in like a stalker way. A man with a good heart that does nice things just because. I want a guy to teach me new things and I would like to teach someone new things as well. I'm not looking for a guy that had moved to America and just lost himself and culture and became a rude slut. I want a man with morals and self respect that's looking to fall in love and get married."

98,"Howdy.

I'm thinking of putting together a singles group for professional people who work/ keep odd hours.  Not for out of work people who will soon go back to their mon-fri 9-5 lives or students.  People who will have the same availablility for a while.  

It would be for or people who work Saturdays, throw barbeques at noon on Wednesdays, go dancing on Thursdays, and enjoy more of SF during the day time or late at night.

No married guys please."
99,"Ahhh summer weather!

Ahhh sunshine and longer days!

Ahhh all the concerts, festivals, outdoor activities and outdoor dining with great summertime food.

I love it all! I would love it more if I had a great guy to enjoy it with. 

Of course the guy needs to be completely and unconditionally single because being ""the other woman"" is not the kind of summer date I am looking for.

A man who is in my age group is strongly preferred.

Drop me a few lines and tell me what you like to do for a summer time date, your age, location, and then we'll chat, maybe set something up."
